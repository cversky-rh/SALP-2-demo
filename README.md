## Overall Guidance

This git repo has been created as part of a larger overall framework that will allow less technical users to demonstrate the business value of our products.  The framework consists of three artifacts:

1) A Miro Board that specifies:
   * Business Value Statement
   * A Specific Scenario that should be addressed
   * The IT Value that should be demonstrated by this demo
2) An Asana Task List that provides step-by-step details on the process that the account team should go through prior to embarking on the demo
3) A Business Value Demo
