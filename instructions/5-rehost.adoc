== Goals of this lab

As you learned how the _Globex retails system_ stands up the application portfolio, the `Oracle database` is still running on the virtual machine to manage the _customers_ data. After you have refactored the customers application, you will need to deploy the application to the OpenShift cluster along with the modernization path for the containerization.

The goal is to migrate the *Oracle virtual machine* from `Red Hat Virtualization` (RHV) to `OpenShift Virtualization` using the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV).

The https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/2.0/html/installing_and_using_the_migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/about-mtv_mtv[MTV^] enables you to migrate virtual machines from VMware vSphere or Red Hat Virtualization to OpenShift Virtualization based on https://kubevirt.io[KubeVirt^], an add-on to OpenShift Container Platform With OpenShift Virtualization, you can run and manage virtual machine workloads alongside container workloads.

== 5.1. Prerequisites

Download the CA Certificate for your RHV environment. You need to do that on your laptop because you will need to drag the file into the Migration Toolkit for the MTV web console later.

Set this variable to the RHV hostname from the *shared environment detail page*. 

Open a new browser to access the following URL. Make sure to replace `RHV_HOSTNAME` with the hostname from the *shared environment detail page* (e.g., *rhvm.dev.cnv.infra.opentlc.com*).

[source,sh]
----
https://<RHV_HOSTNAME>/ovirt-engine/services/pki-resource?resource=ca-certificate&format=X509-PEM-CA
----

On most systems this will download a file `pki-resource.cer` into your `Downloads` folder. Take a note where this file got downloaded to. You will need it a little bit later.

=== 5.2. Set up an OpenShift Project for your migrated VM

The shared cluster already has projects for all users available. But you are migrating a VM as administrator. Therefore you need to create your own project to migrate the VM into.

Switch to a terminal window where you are logged in as admin.

The shared OpenShift cluster has only one or two nodes that are capable of running VMs. These are _metal_ instances on AWS. To ensure that only VMs are running on these nodes the nodes are _tainted_. Which means you must add a matching _toleration_ to your VM to allow it to run on the metal nodes.

Create the target project for your migrated VM.

[source,sh]
----
oc new-project retail
----

The easiest way of adding a matching _toleration_ is to automatically add the _toleration_ to all pods in a project. This can be done by adding an annotation to the namespace that underlies your project.

[source,sh]
----
oc annotate namespace retail scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultTolerations='[{"operator": "Exists", "key": "metal"}]'
----

[WARNING]
====
If your namespace does not have the correct toleration the migration process will fail and your VM will not start.
====

=== 5.3. Set up Virtualization Provider in MTV

Log into the OpenShift Web Console from the *shared environment detail page*.

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `r3dh4t1!`

image::../images/ocp-login.png[ocp-login]

Go to `Virtualization` on the left menu and click on `Virtual Machines`. From the *Projects* drop down select the previously created *retail* project. There are no Virtual Machines yet.

image::../images/ocp-vm.png[ocp-vm]

Click `Launch Migration Tool` to launch the OpenShift Migration Toolkit for Virtualization.

Log in using your *admin* credentials.

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `r3dh4t1!`

If this is the first time you are logging in, click on `Get started` button.

image::../images/mtv-get-started.png[mtv-get-started]

Click `Add provider` on the list of *Providers*.

image::../images/mtv-add-provider.png[mtv-add-provider]

Select *Red Hat Virtualization* from the list of providers. Fill in the information in the *shared environment detail page*.

* Name: `rhv`
* RHV Manager host name or IP address: The hostname in the *shared environment detail page* (e.g., `rhvm.dev.cnv.infra.opentlc.com`)
* RHV Manager user name: the username in the *shared environment detail page*. (e.g., `migrateuser-96trd@internal`)
* RHV Manager password: the password in the *shared environment detail page*. (e.g., `ThvA2Ioa6Q4G`)
* CA Certificate: Drop the previously downloaded CA Certificate File

Click `Add`.

image::../images/mtv-add-provider-detail.png[mtv-add-provider-detail]

MTV will validate your provider and after a few seconds the status should switch to *Ready*.

image::../images/mtv-add-provider-ready.png[mtv-add-provider-ready]

=== 5.4. Create and execute Migration Plan

Go to `Migration Plans` in the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization console. Click `Create Plan`.

image::../images/mtv-create-plan.png[mtv-create-plan]

On the *General settings* page use the following parameters.

* Plan name: `customers-database`
* Source provider: `rhv`
* Target provider: `host` (the OpenShift cluster you are currently on)
* Target namespace: `retail`

Click `Next`.

image::../images/mtv-plan-general.png[mtv-plan-general]

Check `All datacenters` on the *Filter by VM location*. Click `Next`.

image::../images/mtv-plan-vm-loc.png[mtv-plan-vm-loc]

Select the Oracle VM (e.g. _oracle-96trd_) in the *shared environment detail page* on the *Select VMs* page. Click `Next`.

image::../images/mtv-select-vm.png[mtv-select-vm]

Click on *Select a network mapping* on the *Network Mapping* page. Then, Select `Create a network mapping`. Leave the defaults and click `Next`.

image::../images/mtv-select-nw.png[mtv-select-nw]

Click on *Select a storage mapping* on the *Storage Mapping* page. Select `Create a storage mapping`.

Change the *Target Storage Class* to `gp2-csi` and click `Next`.

image::../images/mtv-select-storage.png[mtv-select-storage]

Select `Cold migration` on the *Migration type* page. Click `Next`.

image::../images/mtv-select-cold.png[mtv-select-cold]

Click `Next` on the *Hooks* page.

image::../images/mtv-select-hook.png[mtv-select-hook]

Click `Finish` on the *Review* page.

image::../images/mtv-review.png[mtv-review]

Now your Migration Plan is ready to use. To execute the plan click on `Start` button in the *customers-database* migration plan.

image::../images/mtv-plan-ready.png[mtv-plan-ready]

Confirm by clicking the blue `Start` button in the popup window.

image::../images/mtv-plan-start.png[mtv-plan-start]

Because you are running a *cold migration* the VM in RHV gets shutdown first.

The migration will take about _15 - 25_ minutes after which you will have a running Oracle database VM in your OpenShift cluster.

image::../images/mtv-plan-complete.png[mtv-plan-complete]

Once the migration succeeds you will find a VM called `oracle-xxxxx` in your retail namespace.

== 5.5. Post Migration Tasks

Initially the migrated VM is not yet reachable from other applications on the cluster. You will need to add a label to the VM and then create a service to be able to connect to the database on the VM.

[NOTE]
====
The workshop environment has already created multiple virtual machines separately for the workshop participants. So you will see the unique ID (GUID) for your oracle virtual machine (e.g. _oracle-96trd_) for the provision Message page.
====

Set your GUID as an environment value to avoid repeatable replacement in the following command lines.

Replace `GUID` with your GUID from the *shared environment detail page*. (e.g. _96trd_).

[source,sh]
----
export GUID=YOUR_GUID
----

Make sure you are in the `retail` project:

[source,sh]
----
oc project retail
----

Make the VM accessible from within the OpenShift cluster:

[source,sh]
----
virtctl expose vm oracle-${GUID} --port=1521 --name=oracle-${GUID} --type=ClusterIP
----

Make sure your service has the endpoint for the Oracle VM pod as an Endpoint:

[source,sh]
----
oc describe svc oracle-${GUID} -n retail
----
